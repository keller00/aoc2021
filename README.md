# Advent of code 2021 solutions

My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2021

All `part1.py`s and `part2.py`s are what I used to submit my solutions. Some days I might sacrifice readability for speed if I feel like I could be competitive, while on some days I might just take my time from the beginning for better design.

In some cases when I feel like I want to take a different approach later I will rewrite my solutions, these will be labeled obviously as `rewrite-part1.py`, or `rewrite-part2.py`.

## Workflow

1. `cp -r day00 dayxx` start by copying the folder `day00`, it serves as a template for new days
2. `cd dayxx`
3. `cp code.py part1.py` once the solution is finalized for part 1, save it as `part1.py` and keep working on `code.py`
4. `mv code.py part2.py` once the solution is finished for part 2
